## Who is this for?

**AI Employee is built for solo founders and small agencies** who want leverage — not complexity.

You run a business. You don't have time to manage 35 agents and 147 skills. You just want results:
- 10 qualified leads today
- A sales email in your inbox
- Your customer support running on autopilot

That's exactly what AI Employee does. One AI employee that handles your tasks — powered by specialist AI agents working behind the scenes.

---

## ⚡ Quickstart — Your First Business Result in 15 Minutes

### Option A — Zero-config (recommended for new users, no questions asked):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/F-game25/AI-EMPLOYEE/main/quick-install.sh | bash -s -- --zero-config
```

Installs with safe defaults: local Ollama model, Starter mode, 5 agents. No API keys required.

### Option B — Advanced install (choose your model, mode, integrations):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/F-game25/AI-EMPLOYEE/main/quick-install.sh | bash
```

### After install — generate your first results:

```bash
cd ~/.ai-employee && ./start.sh   # Start your AI employee (opens dashboard)
ai-employee onboard               # Run the First 15 Minutes Value Flow
```

The onboard command auto-runs 3 tasks and shows you the estimated value generated:

```
✅ Generated 10 leads for your business
✅ Wrote 1 sales email
✅ Analysed 1 competitor

✅ Estimated value generated: €1,000 potential
⏱️  Estimated time saved: 4 hours
```

---

## 🎯 Send Any Task

ai-employee do "write a cold sales email for my SaaS product"
ai-employee do "analyse my competitor and find 3 gaps I can exploit"
ai-employee do "create a 30-day content calendar for LinkedIn"
```

Your AI employee handles it — routing to the right specialist agents internally. From the outside, it's just one AI you talk to.

## 🖥️ Dashboard (Primary Control)

Open the dashboard at **http://127.0.0.1:8787** after starting.

The dashboard is your primary control center. Use it for full control over tasks, scheduling, ROI tracking, and agent management.

| Tab | What it shows |
|---|---|
| 📊 Dashboard | Bot status overview, quick actions |
| 💬 Chat | Send tasks, view chat history |
| 🚀 Tasks | Build & launch multi-agent tasks |
| 🐝 Swarm | All agents — status, workload (filterable by category) |
| 📅 Scheduler | Create & manage scheduled tasks |
| 👷 Workers | Start/stop individual bots |
| 📈 ROI | Tasks done, leads, hours saved, €€ saved |
| 📋 Templates | Deploy goal-based templates in one click |
| 🔒 Guardrails | Approval queue, safety logs |
| 🧠 Memory | Client CRM, interaction history |
| 🔌 Integrations | Gmail, Sheets, Telegram, Slack, OpenAI |

---

## 📱 WhatsApp — Quick Commands & Notifications

> **WhatsApp is for quick checks and notifications — not your primary control system.**
> Use the dashboard for full control.

After starting, link WhatsApp optionally:

```bash
openclaw channels login   # Scan QR code once
```

WhatsApp lets you:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `status` | Quick status check |
| `workers` | List running bots |
| `help` | Show available commands |

Get notified when tasks complete, leads are generated, or deals close — without leaving your phone.

For everything else: **use the dashboard**.

2. Download `install-mac.sh`
3. Open Terminal and run: `bash ~/Downloads/install-mac.sh`

> **Requires Homebrew.** The installer will offer to install it automatically.

### 🪟 Windows 10 / 11

**No WSL or Git Bash required** — fully native PowerShell installer.

**One-click install:**
1. Go to → https://github.com/F-game25/AI-EMPLOYEE/tree/windows
2. Download **`quick-install-windows.bat`**
3. Double-click the file to install

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install-windows.ps1
```
```

---

## Install Options

### Zero-config (fastest, no questions):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/F-game25/AI-EMPLOYEE/main/quick-install.sh | bash -s -- --zero-config
```
- No questions asked
- Uses Ollama local model (free, private)
- Starter mode (3 agents)
- No API keys required
- Change settings later in `~/.ai-employee/.env`

### Advanced install (choose everything):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/F-game25/AI-EMPLOYEE/main/quick-install.sh | bash
```
- Choose your LLM (Ollama local or cloud)
- Configure API keys
- Select mode (starter/business/power)
- Set ports and number of agents

### macOS native installer:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/F-game25/AI-EMPLOYEE/main/quick-install-mac.sh | bash
```
macOS-specific installer with Homebrew integration, automatic dependency setup, and `.command` desktop launcher.

### Windows native installer (PowerShell):
```powershell
# Run in PowerShell as your regular user:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/F-game25/AI-EMPLOYEE/main/install-windows.ps1 -OutFile install-windows.ps1
.\install-windows.ps1
```
Or use the one-click batch file: download and run `quick-install-windows.bat`.
No WSL or Git Bash required — installs Python, Git, Ollama, and all 35 bots natively.

Everything is installed into **`~/.ai-employee/`** (Linux/macOS) or **`%USERPROFILE%\.ai-employee\`** (Windows).

### Update (re-run installer):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/F-game25/AI-EMPLOYEE/main/quick-install.sh | bash
```
Re-running upgrades runtime files **without overwriting** your existing config or `.env`.

### What the installer asks (advanced mode)

The step-by-step wizard asks:

1. WhatsApp phone number (E.164 format, e.g. `+31612345678`)
2. Local LLM via Ollama? (yes/no + model name)
3. Anthropic / OpenAI API keys (optional)
4. Alpha Insider, Tavily, NewsAPI keys (optional)
5. Telegram / Discord / SMTP (optional)
6. Enable hourly WhatsApp status updates?
7. Dashboard port (default: 8787)
8. Number of workers (1–35, default: 35)

---

## Start / Stop

### 🐧 Linux / 🍎 macOS


```bash
# Start (opens dashboard automatically)
cd ~/.ai-employee && ./start.sh

# Stop
cd ~/.ai-employee && ./stop.sh

# Or use the CLI from anywhere:
ai-employee start
ai-employee stop
ai-employee status
```

Stop: `./stop.sh` or Ctrl+C in the terminal.

**Desktop launchers** (created by installer — smart, no terminal needed):

The desktop button is *smart*: it checks whether the bot is already running.
- **Bot running** → opens the dashboard in your browser instantly
- **Bot not running** → starts the bot (which opens the browser automatically)

| Platform | Button | How it works |
|---|---|---|
| **Linux** | `~/Desktop/ai-employee.desktop` or "AI Employee" in app menu | Smart launcher: open UI or start bot |
| **macOS** | `~/Desktop/AI-Employee.command` | Smart launcher: open UI or start bot in Terminal |
| **Windows** | `AI Employee.bat` on Desktop | Smart launcher: open UI or start bot in PowerShell |
| **Linux autostart** | `systemctl --user enable --now ai-employee` | Auto-starts on login |
| **macOS autostart** | `launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ai-employee.plist` | Auto-starts on login |

### 🪟 Windows

Double-click **`Start AI Employee.bat`** on your Desktop.

Or run from PowerShell:
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "$env:USERPROFILE\.ai-employee\start-windows.ps1"
```

Stop: Double-click **`Stop AI Employee.bat`** on your Desktop.

### All platforms — browser URLs

After starting, the browser opens automatically. URLs:
- **Full Dashboard:** http://127.0.0.1:8787 ← main UI

- **Gateway API:** http://localhost:18789

---

Re-run the installer for your platform to upgrade runtime files without touching your config.

- **Linux:** `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/F-game25/AI-EMPLOYEE/main/quick-install.sh | bash`
- **macOS:** `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/F-game25/AI-EMPLOYEE/mac/quick-install-mac.sh | bash`
- **Windows:** Re-run `quick-install-windows.bat` or `install-windows.ps1`

---

## Connect WhatsApp (first time)

After starting, open a **new terminal** (Linux/macOS) or PowerShell (Windows) and run:

```bash
openclaw channels login
```

Scan the QR code in WhatsApp:  
**WhatsApp → Linked Devices → Link a device**

Wait for "Connected" ✓ — then send yourself a WhatsApp message to test.

---

## WhatsApp Commands

Send these to your own WhatsApp number:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| **lead-hunter** | B2B lead generation + cold outreach |
| **content-master** | SEO blog posts + long-form content |
| **social-guru** | Viral social media + captions + hashtags |
| **intel-agent** | Competitor monitoring + market research |
| **email-ninja** | Cold email sequences + deliverability |
| **support-bot** | Customer support + FAQ + ticket routing |
| **data-analyst** | Market trends + reports + KPI tracking |
| **creative-studio** | Ad copy + design briefs + campaign concepts |
| **web-sales** | Website audits + UX + sales pitches |

---

## 🎮 Discord Bot — Control Panel & Live Notifications

> **Why Discord?** Keep an eye on your AI employee from your phone or PC — without leaving Discord. The bot posts automatic alerts when leads are found or follow-ups are sent, and lets you control the CRM with simple `!commands`.

### There are two Discord features:

| Feature | What it does | What you need |
|---|---|---|
| **Incoming Webhook** | Bot *posts* automatic alerts to a channel | A Discord webhook URL |
| **Discord Bot (!commands)** | You *talk to* the bot with `!lead list` etc. | A Discord Bot Token |

You can use one or both.

---

### 🔔 Part 1 — Automatic Notifications via Webhook (easiest)

When a webhook URL is set the system automatically posts:
- 🎯 **New leads found** (how many, for which niche)
- 📤 **Follow-ups sent** (which leads, attempt number)
- 🤖 **Hourly status report** (all bot statuses)

#### Step 1 — Create a webhook in Discord

1. Open Discord → go to the channel where you want notifications
2. Click the ⚙️ gear icon next to the channel name → **Edit Channel**
3. Click **Integrations** → **Webhooks** → **New Webhook**
4. Give it a name (e.g. `AI Employee`) and click **Copy Webhook URL**

#### Step 2 — Add the URL to your config

Open `~/.ai-employee/.env` in a text editor:

```bash
nano ~/.ai-employee/.env
```

Add (or uncomment) this line:

```env
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR_ID/YOUR_TOKEN
```

Save (`Ctrl+X → Y → Enter`) and restart:

```bash
cd ~/.ai-employee && ./stop.sh && ./start.sh
```

That's it — the next time a lead is found you'll see a message in Discord. ✅

---

### 🤖 Part 2 — Discord Bot with !commands (interactive control panel)

The bot lets you manage leads and trigger follow-ups directly from Discord.

#### Step 1 — Create a Discord application & bot

1. Go to → https://discord.com/developers/applications
2. Click **New Application** → give it a name (e.g. `AI Employee`)
3. In the left menu click **Bot** → click **Add Bot** → confirm
4. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents** turn ON **Message Content Intent**
5. Click **Reset Token** → **Copy** the token (you only see it once!)

#### Step 2 — Invite the bot to your server

1. Still in the Developer Portal → click **OAuth2** → **URL Generator**
2. Under **Scopes** tick `bot`
3. Under **Bot Permissions** tick `Send Messages` and `Read Message History`
4. Copy the generated URL → open it in your browser → select your server → **Authorize**

#### Step 3 — Add the token to your config

```bash
nano ~/.ai-employee/.env
```

Add:

```env
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
DISCORD_COMMAND_PREFIX=!
```

#### Step 4 — Start the Discord bot

```bash
cd ~/.ai-employee/bots/discord-bot
python3 discord_bot.py
```

Or start it in the background (it will keep running):

```bash
nohup python3 ~/.ai-employee/bots/discord-bot/discord_bot.py \
  >> ~/.ai-employee/logs/discord-bot.log 2>&1 &
echo "Discord bot started (PID $!)"
```

#### Step 5 — Test it

In Discord, type in the channel where the bot is present:

```
!help
```

You should see the command overview. 🎉

### Managing skills via WhatsApp / Chat

```
skills                              → show library summary
skills categories                   → list all categories
skills list Trading & Finance       → list skills in a category
skills search blog                  → search by name/tag/description
agents                              → list all custom agents

create agent My Writer with blog_writing, headline_generation, seo_optimization
add skill keyword_research to My Writer
remove skill keyword_research from My Writer
delete agent My Writer
```

### skills-manager agent

The `skills-manager` runs in the background, polls the chatlog every 5 seconds, and processes all skills commands.  Custom agents are stored in `~/.ai-employee/config/custom_agents.json`.

Each custom agent has a generated **system prompt** that describes all its assigned skills, ready to use with any LLM.

Configure in `~/.ai-employee/config/skills-manager.env`:
```env
SKILLS_MANAGER_POLL_INTERVAL=5   # seconds between chatlog polls
SKILLS_MANAGER_MAX_SKILLS=20     # max skills per agent
```

### External signals for MiroFish skills

When `mirofish_prediction` skill is used, populate `~/.ai-employee/config/mirofish_signals.json` with signals for each market (see MiroFish section above).

## OpenClaw 2.0 Integration

> **Note:** If you have an `openclaw-2.0` (safe version) repository, place its `main` file at:
> ```
> ~/.ai-employee/bin/openclaw2
> ```
> Then set `OPENCLAW_BIN=openclaw2` in `~/.ai-employee/.env` to have the start script use it instead of the standard `openclaw` binary.  The `start.sh` script already reads `OPENCLAW_BIN` from the environment for this purpose.
>
> *Share your openclaw 2.0 repo URL to integrate it directly into this repo.*

## MiroFish Swarm Intelligence

[MiroFish](https://github.com/666ghj/MiroFish) is an open-source multi-agent prediction engine that simulates thousands of autonomous agents to forecast real-world outcomes.  AI Employee integrates MiroFish in two ways:

### Inline predictor (polymarket-trader)

The trader runs a lightweight swarm simulation on every market quote to estimate the probability of YES resolution.  Each agent has a random personality (optimism bias, herd tendency, expertise) and iteratively updates its belief by blending its own signal processing with the emerging crowd consensus.

Configure in `~/.ai-employee/config/polymarket-trader.env`:

```env
MIROFISH_ENABLED=true
MIROFISH_AGENTS=200    # agents per simulation (lower = faster)
MIROFISH_ROUNDS=15     # interaction rounds per simulation
```

### mirofish-researcher agent (separate)

A dedicated background agent that runs deeper simulations (more agents, more rounds, multi-scenario analysis) and writes probability estimates to `~/.ai-employee/config/polymarket_estimates.json`.  The polymarket-trader automatically reads these and blends them (60 % researcher weight, 40 % inline simulation) for higher-quality signals.

**Start / stop:**
```bash
~/.ai-employee/bin/ai-employee start mirofish-researcher
~/.ai-employee/bin/ai-employee stop  mirofish-researcher
~/.ai-employee/bin/ai-employee logs  mirofish-researcher
```

**Configure markets to research** — edit `~/.ai-employee/config/mirofish-researcher.env`:
```env
MIROFISH_RESEARCH_INTERVAL=300   # seconds between research cycles
MIROFISH_AGENTS=500
MIROFISH_ROUNDS=20
MIROFISH_SCENARIOS=5
RESEARCH_MARKETS=market-id-1,market-id-2
```

**Provide external signals** — edit `~/.ai-employee/config/mirofish_signals.json`:
```json
{
  "your-market-id": {
    "sentiment":    0.3,
    "volume_trend": 0.1,
    "news_impact":  0.2
  }
}
```
Each signal is in `[-1, 1]`: `-1` = very bearish/negative/declining, `+1` = very bullish/positive/increasing.

**Research output** is available at:
- `~/.ai-employee/state/mirofish-researcher.state.json` — full per-market report with distribution analysis and scenario confidence intervals
- `~/.ai-employee/config/polymarket_estimates.json` — prob_yes per market (consumed by trader)

The hourly WhatsApp status report now includes a MiroFish research summary line.

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal shows "openclaw.bash: file not found" on every open

The openclaw installer adds a `source` line to your `~/.bashrc` but does not always
create the target file.  One-time fix:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/completions
touch ~/.openclaw/completions/openclaw.bash
```

Re-open your terminal — the error will be gone.  
The AI Employee installer now creates this stub automatically, so fresh installs are not affected.

### Docker not running
```
⚠ Docker installed but not running.
```
Start Docker: `sudo systemctl start docker` (Linux) or open Docker Desktop (macOS/Windows).  
Agents work without Docker (local exec mode).

### Node.js version too old
```
⚠ Node.js 20+ recommended
```
Upgrade: https://nodejs.org or `nvm install 22`

### Python / pip not found
```
⚠ pip3 not found
```
Install: `sudo apt install python3-pip` or `brew install python3`  
Then manually: `pip3 install --user fastapi uvicorn`

### OpenClaw "Missing config" error
This means the config was not linked correctly. Fix:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw
ln -sf ~/.ai-employee/config.json ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
openclaw gateway --config ~/.ai-employee/config.json
```

Bot-specific logs:
```bash
~/.ai-employee/bin/ai-employee logs claude-agent
~/.ai-employee/bin/ai-employee logs ollama-agent
```

---

## 10) Uninstall / Remove everything
### OpenClaw gateway won't start
Check that `gateway.mode` is set to `local` in your config:
```bash
grep '"mode"' ~/.ai-employee/config.json | head -3
```
Should show: `"mode": "local"`

### WhatsApp messages not received
1. Check phone format in config: must be E.164 (`+31612345678`)
2. Check allowlist: `grep allowFrom ~/.ai-employee/config.json`
3. Re-link: `openclaw channels login`

### UI not opening
Start it manually:
```bash
cd ~/.ai-employee/bots/problem-solver-ui
python3 server.py
```
Then open: http://127.0.0.1:8787

### Check bot logs
```bash
~/.ai-employee/bin/ai-employee logs problem-solver-ui
~/.ai-employee/bin/ai-employee logs status-reporter
~/.ai-employee/bin/ai-employee status
```

## Security Notes

- The installer generates a random token stored in `~/.ai-employee/.env`
- **Never share** `~/.ai-employee/.env` or `~/.ai-employee/config.json`
- The gateway only listens on `loopback` (localhost) by default
- WhatsApp `dmPolicy: allowlist` ensures only your phone can send commands
- The discovery bot is read-only — proposals require explicit approval
- API keys are stored locally and never sent to third parties by this software

---

## Uninstall

```bash
cd ~/.ai-employee && ./stop.sh || true
rm -rf ~/.ai-employee
rm -f ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

> This does not uninstall Docker, Node.js, Python, or OpenClaw itself.

## Security notes

- The installer generates a local token and stores it in `~/.ai-employee/.env`.
- Don't share `~/.ai-employee/.env` or `~/.ai-employee/config.json`.
- Review scripts before running, especially if you modify install sources.
- Your Anthropic API key is stored in `~/.ai-employee/.env` (chmod 600).
- The Ollama agent processes all data locally — no external API calls are made.
## Keeping Your Local Copy Up to Date

### One-time sync (manual):
```bash
bash scripts/sync.sh
```

### Auto-sync every 30 minutes (runs in terminal):
```bash
bash scripts/sync-watch.sh
```

### Auto-sync via cron (runs in background, survives terminal close):
```bash
bash scripts/setup-cron.sh
```

### View sync history:
```bash
cat ~/.ai-employee/logs/sync.log
```

### Stop auto-sync:
```bash
crontab -e   # delete the sync line
```
