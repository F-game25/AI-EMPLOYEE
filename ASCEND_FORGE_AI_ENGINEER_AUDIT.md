# 1. Executive Summary

**Verdict: PARTIALLY — a strong foundation exists, but execution is fragmented and the "AI engineering engine" loop is not yet closed end-to-end.**

AscendForge is **not** a UI shell and **not** a fake prototype. There is real, substantial machinery:

- A real Node forge API (~170 routes in [backend/routes/forge.js](backend/routes/forge.js), 6.5k LOC) with projects, runs, plans, actions, approvals, snapshots/rollback, sandbox, swarm, and a persistent Python worker bridge ([run_forge.py](backend/run_forge.py)).
- A real **project indexing** layer ([runtime/core/code_indexer.py](runtime/core/code_indexer.py) + [runtime/neural_brain/api/code_index_router.py](runtime/neural_brain/api/code_index_router.py)) called over HTTP via `callCodeIndex` ([forge.js:1325](backend/routes/forge.js#L1325)).
- A real **context-compression** engine ([backend/services/forge_context_engine.js](backend/services/forge_context_engine.js): `buildContextPacket` + `compressContext(budget)`).
- A real **multi-provider model router** ([runtime/core/llm_provider_router.py](runtime/core/llm_provider_router.py), [runtime/engine/compute/compute_planner.py](runtime/engine/compute/compute_planner.py) with tiers `local_tiny → local_coder → openrouter_free → rent_gpu`).
- A real **sandbox** ([backend/infra/sandbox/executor.js](backend/infra/sandbox/executor.js): Docker + process fallback, command allowlist, cpu/mem/timeout/net limits).
- A real **Python forge lifecycle** ([runtime/forge/lifecycle/](runtime/forge/lifecycle/): spec→plan→implement→test→review→simplify→ship).
- Real **distillation/learning writeback** ([backend/services/forge_learning.js](backend/services/forge_learning.js), wired at [forge.js:4114](backend/routes/forge.js#L4114)).
- A real **swarm** scaffold ([runtime/agents/business_swarm/](runtime/agents/business_swarm/): decomposer, assignment, parallel executor, aggregator).
- Real **frontend** ([frontend/src/components/pages/AscendForgePage.jsx](frontend/src/components/pages/AscendForgePage.jsx), [forgeStore.js](frontend/src/store/forgeStore.js), [ForgeQueuePanel.jsx](frontend/src/components/forge/ForgeQueuePanel.jsx)).
- Decent **tests** (`test_ascend_forge.py`, `test_forge.py`, `test_forge_run_routes.js`, `test_forge_v5_runtime.py`, `test_business_swarm.py`, `test_model_lanes.py`).

**The brutal-honesty part — why "PARTIALLY" and not "YES":**

1. **Two disconnected forge execution paths.** The UI-facing `POST /api/forge/runs` does *single-LLM Ollama codegen* (`_callOllama`, [forge.js:1454/1551](backend/routes/forge.js#L1454)), while the richer Python lifecycle engines ([runtime/forge/lifecycle/](runtime/forge/lifecycle/)) are only reachable through the **companion** path ([runtime/companion/execution_broker.py:1286](runtime/companion/execution_broker.py#L1286)) and [forge_v5_runtime.py:272](runtime/core/forge_v5_runtime.py#L272) — not from the main run route. The two best halves don't talk.
2. **No high-level orchestrator role for Claude/OpenAI.** Until the work shipped today (MCP brain-connector + scoped service tokens + forge→AgentController dispatcher), there was no programmatic, least-privilege way for an external planner to read state and emit work. That bridge now exists but is *single-tool* (submit) — it is not yet the full plan→decompose→review loop.
3. **Remote compute is scaffolding only.** [backend/compute_fabric/index.js](backend/compute_fabric/index.js) defines `runpod`/`vastai` providers but both `enabled: false` with **no provider adapter** — provisioning is physically refused.
4. **Swarm is not used by forge.** `business_swarm` and `/api/forge/swarm` exist, but the run pipeline never routes work through the swarm.
5. **OpenAI is only reachable via OpenRouter** ([runtime/core/openrouter_client.py](runtime/core/openrouter_client.py)); there is no dedicated direct-OpenAI orchestrator adapter.

So: the *parts* of a real AI engineering engine are mostly present and mostly real, but the **connective tissue** (one run pipeline, an orchestrator bridge, a live remote-compute adapter, swarm routing for heavy work) is missing or fragmented.

# 4. Critical Gaps

### GAP-1 — Two disconnected forge execution paths (CRITICAL → ADDRESSED 2026-06-22)
> **Status update:** the cockpit `POST /api/forge/runs` (+`/runs/stream`) now runs the
> deterministic lifecycle gate (spec→plan→review→test→ship) in front of codegen via a new
> `lifecycle` op in `run_forge.py` + `runLifecycleGate()` in forge.js. Vague spec / P0 review /
> failed tests block the run (with open questions) before any codegen; otherwise the lifecycle
> result is attached to `run.lifecycle`. Env-gated (`FORGE_LIFECYCLE_RUNS`), graceful fallback,
> approval gate unchanged. Remaining follow-up: feed lifecycle plan slices into codegen targeting,
> and surface `open_questions` in the cockpit UI (Phase 9).

- **Evidence:** Node `/api/forge/runs` uses `_callOllama` for codegen ([forge.js:1551](backend/routes/forge.js#L1551)); the structured lifecycle (`planning_engine`/`implementation_engine`/`test_engine`/`review_engine`) is only invoked from [companion/execution_broker.py:1286](runtime/companion/execution_broker.py#L1286) and [forge_v5_runtime.py:272](runtime/core/forge_v5_runtime.py#L272).
- **Why it matters:** the UI-facing engine is the *weaker* one (single LLM, no test/review gating); the *stronger* lifecycle is hidden behind the companion.
- **What breaks:** runs created from the cockpit don't get plan→test→review rigor; quality is inconsistent; "verified result" promise is weak on the default path.
- **Severity:** CRITICAL · **Files:** forge.js, forge_v5_runtime.py, forge/lifecycle/*
- **Fix:** make `/api/forge/runs` delegate to the Python lifecycle (one canonical pipeline) OR explicitly demote one path. Do not maintain two.

### GAP-2 — Orchestrator bridge for Claude/OpenAI as planners (CRITICAL → ADDRESSED 2026-06-22)
> **Status update:** the orchestrator bridge now exists over the scoped-token + MCP surface:
> `GET /api/forge/context-pack` (read — compressed context for cheap planning),
> `POST /api/forge/orchestrate` (task-emit — emit a decomposed task graph as `proposed`
> forge_queue_items linked by `orchestration_id`), and `GET /api/forge/runs/:id/failures`
> (read — compressed failure context). MCP tools: `get_context_pack`, `orchestrate`,
> `get_run_failures`. The brain now plans/decomposes/reviews; tasks flow through the existing
> approval → dispatcher → run_goal loop. The brain still NEVER executes directly.
> Remaining follow-up: feed `verification_command`/`affected_files` into the dispatcher's
> run + auto-pull failures back to the brain (Phase 6 result-verifier loop).


### GAP-3 — Remote compute has no provider adapter (HIGH)
- **Evidence:** [compute_fabric/index.js:50-51](backend/compute_fabric/index.js#L50) `runpod`/`vastai` `enabled:false`; `compute_planner` lists `rent_gpu` but routing falls back ([compute_planner.py:112-119](runtime/engine/compute/compute_planner.py#L112)).
- **Why it matters:** "rent stronger machines / swarms" is impossible today.
- **Severity:** HIGH · **Files:** compute_fabric/index.js, compute_fabric/persistence.js, compute_router.py
- **Fix:** Phase 7 worker protocol + one real provider adapter, owner-gated by `COMPUTE_FABRIC_LIVE=1`.

### GAP-4 — Swarm exists but forge never uses it (HIGH)
- **Evidence:** `business_swarm/*` + `/api/forge/swarm` + `/mirofish` exist; `/runs` codegen path never calls them.
- **Why it matters:** heavy/parallel coding work can't fan out.
- **Severity:** HIGH · **Fix:** Phase 8 — route heavy run tasks through swarm coordinator after the orchestrator decides parallelism is warranted.

### GAP-5 — No semantic/prompt cache; compression not enforced on API path (MEDIUM)
- **Evidence:** `compressContext` exists but `/runs` builds context independently; no cache layer found for repeated LLM calls.
- **Why it matters:** token waste when the brain re-reads context; violates the cost goal.
- **Severity:** MEDIUM · **Fix:** Phase 3 — token budget manager + semantic cache in front of every API call.

### GAP-6 — `/metrics` 500 + broken programmatic auth (HIGH → FIXED today)
- **Evidence (now fixed):** `/metrics` missing `taskMetrics`/`startTime` deps (500); `/api/auth/token` missing `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` dep (500); `/api/auth/service-token` blocked by tenancy allowlist.
- **Status:** all three fixed and verified live this session.

---

# 5. Bugs and Broken Integrations

### BUG-1 — `GET /metrics` returned 500 *(FIXED)*
- Files: [health.js:1004](backend/routes/health.js#L1004), [server.js](backend/server.js). Cause: `taskMetrics`/`startTime` not passed into health router deps. Fix: added to `_routeDeps`. Verified: 200 + valid Prometheus.

### BUG-2 — `POST /api/auth/token` returned 500 *(FIXED)*
- Files: [auth-identity.js:132](backend/routes/auth-identity.js#L132). Cause: `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` undefined in route deps → `jwt.sign({expiresIn:undefined})` throws. Fix: passed `JWT_EXPIRES_IN` into deps. Verified: 200.

### BUG-3 — Forge approval queue was an open loop *(FIXED)*
- Files: [forge.js:4192](backend/routes/forge.js#L4192) (approve set status but nothing dispatched). Fix: [backend/forge/dispatcher.js](backend/forge/dispatcher.js) drains approved → `run_goal`. Verified: full lifecycle + audit.

### ISSUE-4 — Dual forge pipelines (see GAP-1)
- Repro: create a run via cockpit vs via companion `forge.lifecycle_plan` → different rigor. Fix strategy: unify on the Python lifecycle.

### ISSUE-5 — `requestPythonJSON` default 3s timeout vs LLM runs
- File: [server.js:1996](backend/server.js#L1996) default `timeoutMs: 3000`. The new dispatcher overrides to 180s, but other callers of `/api/tasks/run` may truncate long runs. Fix: audit all callers for explicit timeouts.

### ISSUE-6 — Remote compute providers permanently disabled (see GAP-3)
- File: compute_fabric/index.js. Repro: any rent attempt → refused. Fix: provider adapter behind owner gate.

---

# 6. Token Efficiency Audit

**Present:**
- Hierarchical context packing + per-stage relevance scoring + budget compression: [forge_context_engine.js](backend/services/forge_context_engine.js) (`buildContextPacket`, `compressContext(budget=4000)`, token-overlap scoring).
- Cost ledger / model lanes: [runtime/core/cost_ledger.py](runtime/core/cost_ledger.py), [model_lanes.py](runtime/core/model_lanes.py).
- Local-first routing: [compute_planner.py](runtime/engine/compute/compute_planner.py) prefers local tiers before `openrouter_free`/`rent_gpu`.
- Prompt inspection/tracing: [prompt_inspector.py](runtime/core/prompt_inspector.py), `distributed_tracing.py`.

**Missing / weak:**
- No **semantic cache** or **prompt-cache-aware** request shaping for forge LLM calls.
- Compression is **not enforced** on the default `/runs` path or on the new MCP/orchestrator surface.
- No **token budget manager** that caps per-task/per-run/per-day API spend at the forge layer (cost_ledger records, doesn't enforce a forge budget).
- No **dependency-aware retrieval** beyond keyword overlap (no call-graph/import-graph-driven selection).

**Proposed design (cost-correct):**
1. Claude/OpenAI receive only a **compressed context pack** (tree skeleton + file summaries + top-k relevant snippets), never raw repo.
2. A **token budget manager** gates every API call; over-budget → degrade to local model or queue.
3. A **semantic cache** keyed on (goal-hash, context-hash, model) returns prior plans/reviews.
4. Local agents do summarization/mapping/simple edits; API is reserved for plan/review/hard-debug.
5. Distillation writeback ([forge_learning.js](backend/services/forge_learning.js)) feeds the cache so repeated patterns get cheaper over time.

---

# 7. OpenAI + Claude Orchestrator Design

**Role:** strategic planner · architecture reviewer · task decomposer · error investigator · final reviewer · prompt/task generator for local agents. **Not** for: reading every file, simple edits, running tests, raw log scanning, direct shell.

**Transport already built this session:** scoped service tokens (`read` / `task-emit`) + MCP brain-connector + forge→AgentController dispatcher (approval-gated).

**Loop to implement (Phase 4):**
```
User goal
  → Forge builds compressed context pack (forge_context_engine + code_index)
  → API orchestrator (Claude/OpenAI) reviews pack → produces plan + task graph
  → tasks queued as forge_queue_items (proposed)            [MCP forge_submit / new bridge]
  → human approves (HITL)                                    [existing approval gate]
  → dispatcher → local agents execute (run_goal / lifecycle) [NEW dispatcher]
  → sandbox runs tests                                       [infra/sandbox/executor]
  → failures compressed → API orchestrator reviews ONLY compressed failure context
  → local agents fix → final verification → distillation writeback
```
**Key constraint:** orchestrator I/O always flows through the **scoped-token + approval** surface added today; it never gets shell or unscoped DB access.

---

# 8. Local Agent Task Delegation System

Build on the existing `forge_queue_item` action (already has id/label/description/status/risk/approval fields — [forge.js:4173](backend/routes/forge.js#L4173)) and `AgentController.run_goal`. Extend the action contract to a **task card**:

```
task_id · title · goal · affected_files[] · context_packet_ref · constraints ·
allowed_actions[] · forbidden_actions[] · expected_output · verification_command ·
rollback_plan · status · logs_ref · reviewer_result
```
Local agents (cheap models) handle: file summarization, route/dependency mapping, simple bug fixes, test writing, docs, UI cleanup, refactor *suggestions*, log analysis, security checks, regression checks. **High-risk → approval required** (reuse autonomy levels [forge.js:1599](backend/routes/forge.js#L1599) + HITL gate). Reuse `compute_planner` to pick the cheapest capable model per task.

---

# 9. Remote Compute Architecture

Current state: scaffolding only ([compute_fabric/index.js](backend/compute_fabric/index.js), providers disabled). Design a real **worker protocol** (Phase 7):

- Worker **registration** (pairing token) + **capability report** (GPU/VRAM/RAM/CPU, installed models).
- **Health checks** + heartbeat + disconnect recovery.
- **Secure job dispatch** (signed jobs, scoped secrets, never raw `.env`).
- **Sandboxed execution** on the worker (mirror `infra/sandbox/executor`).
- **Artifact** upload/download + **job logs** streaming + **timeout**.
- **Cost tracking** (extend `cost_ledger`) + **trust levels** + **queue** + **fallback to local**.
- **Approval gates** for dangerous jobs; owner-gated by `COMPUTE_FABRIC_LIVE=1` + provider creds.

Lifecycle: add creds/pairing → worker installs remote agent → registers → reports caps → system assigns compatible jobs → sandboxed exec → streams logs → returns artifacts → system verifies → stored in audit/task memory. **Not** "SSH and hope" — a real protocol with `remote_worker_registry` + `remote_job_dispatcher`.

---

# 10. Security Model

**Existing controls (verified):** JWT auth ([server.js:317](backend/server.js#L317)); **NEW scoped tokens + `requireScope`** (deny-by-default); tenancy isolation ([tenancy.js](backend/tenancy.js)); HITL gate; sandbox allowlist + limits; audit to `audit.db` + jsonl; internal service token for Node→Python; secrets via env/secret broker; `METRICS_TOKEN` gate.

**Action classification:**
- **SAFE:** read files, summarize code, inspect package files, static analysis (no net).
- **CAUTION (require review):** install packages, modify source, run tests, call external APIs, start local servers.
- **DANGEROUS (require explicit approval):** delete/overwrite files, modify system config, sudo/admin, upload secrets, change auth, expose ports, deploy, run unknown scripts.
- **BLOCKED by default:** destructive cmds w/o approval, credential exfiltration, disabling security, unsafe remote shell, touching unrelated user files.

**Gaps to close:** treat repo/file content as untrusted in orchestrator prompts (prompt-injection guard); per-scope rate limits on the MCP write surface; redact failure context before sending to APIs; remote-worker trust levels (Phase 7).

---

# 11. Implementation Plan

## Phase 1 — Truth Audit & Broken-Flow Fixes
- **Goal:** clean baseline; no 500s; closed approval loop. **Status: largely DONE this session.**
- **Files:** server.js, health.js, auth-identity.js, tenancy.js, forge.js, backend/forge/dispatcher.js, mcp/*.
- **Tasks:** ✅ /metrics fix · ✅ /api/auth/token fix · ✅ scoped service tokens + requireScope · ✅ dispatcher · ✅ MCP connector. Remaining: audit `requestPythonJSON` timeouts (ISSUE-5).
- **Verification:** ✅ live curl matrix + dispatch + MCP loop (this session). `npm test` for regression.
- **Risks:** low (additive, reversible).

## Phase 2 — Real Project Understanding Layer
- **Goal:** one structured project map (services/routes/boundaries/data stores/model flow) from real code.
- **Files:** runtime/core/code_indexer.py, code_index_router.py, forge_context_engine.js, forge.js (`/index`, `buildContextPack`).
- **Tasks:** add structured architecture extraction (routes, imports/call graph, frontend/backend boundary) on top of existing index; persist as a reusable project map.
- **Verification:** index this repo; assert the map lists `/api/forge/*`, Node/Python boundary, state files.
- **Risks:** index quality depends on Python up; large repos cost — cap via budget.

## Phase 3 — Context Compression & Token Efficiency
- **Goal:** every API call uses compressed context + budget + cache.
- **Files:** forge_context_engine.js, cost_ledger.py, NEW `services/token_budget_manager.js`, NEW `services/prompt_cache_manager.js`.
- **Tasks:** enforce `compressContext` on all API paths; add semantic cache; add per-task/run/day budget enforcement (extend cost_ledger).
- **Verification:** repeated goal hits cache (0 API tokens); over-budget degrades to local.
- **Risks:** cache invalidation correctness.

## Phase 4 — OpenAI/Claude Orchestrator Bridge
- **Goal:** API acts as planner/decomposer/reviewer over the scoped-token surface.
- **Files:** mcp/server.js (extend), forge.js (orchestrator routes), system_api.py, NEW `services/orchestrator_bridge.js`.
- **Tasks:** add `plan`, `decompose`, `review_failures` tools/routes (read compressed context, emit task graph, review only compressed failures); keep approval-gated.
- **Verification:** goal → plan → task cards queued → approve → execute → review loop end-to-end.
- **Risks:** prompt injection from repo content — add guard.

## Phase 5 — Local Agent Task Graph
- **Goal:** task cards executable by cheap local agents with verification + rollback.
- **Files:** forge.js (extend action contract), agent_controller.py, compute_planner.py.
- **Tasks:** extend `forge_queue_item` → task card (Section 8); route each card to cheapest capable model; capture reviewer_result.
- **Verification:** a simple bug-fix card runs locally, tests pass, reviewer signs off.
- **Risks:** weak-model quality — gate high-risk to approval.

## Phase 6 — Sandbox Execution & Result Verification
- **Goal:** every code change is tested in sandbox; no fake-done.
- **Files:** infra/sandbox/executor.js, forge.js (`/runs/:id/verify`), NEW `services/result_verifier.js`.
- **Tasks:** auto-run verification_command in sandbox after each card; require `all_passed` before `completed`.
- **Verification:** failing tests block completion; status `verify_failed`.
- **Risks:** sandbox coverage (Docker vs process fallback).

## Phase 7 — Remote Compute Worker Protocol
- **Goal:** real worker registration/dispatch (Section 9), owner-gated.
- **Files:** compute_fabric/index.js, persistence.js, compute_router.py, NEW `services/remote_worker_registry.js`, NEW `services/remote_job_dispatcher.js`, NEW `routes/remote_compute.js`.
- **Tasks:** one provider adapter; pairing/registration; capability report; sandboxed remote exec; artifacts; cost; fallback to local.
- **Verification:** register a worker (or mock), dispatch a job, verify artifact + audit.
- **Risks:** HIGH — secrets handling, trust, network. Behind `COMPUTE_FABRIC_LIVE=1`.

## Phase 8 — Coding Swarm Layer
- **Goal:** heavy/parallel run tasks fan out via swarm.
- **Files:** business_swarm/*, core/swarm/swarm_controller.py, forge.js (`/swarm`), NEW `services/swarm_coordinator.js`.
- **Tasks:** orchestrator decides parallelism → swarm decomposes/executes/aggregates → results verified.
- **Verification:** a multi-file refactor runs across N agents and aggregates.
- **Risks:** coordination/merge conflicts.

## Phase 9 — UI Integration
- **Goal:** cockpit panels for orchestration, task graph, remote compute.
- **Files:** AscendForgePage.jsx, components/forge/*, forgeStore.js, NEW orchestration/task-graph/remote-compute panels.
- **Tasks:** surface plan→tasks→approve→execute→verify; show budgets, model routing, worker status.
- **Verification:** drive the full loop from the UI.
- **Risks:** keep UI a view over backend truth (no frontend-only state).

## Phase 10 — Enterprise Hardening
- **Goal:** rate limits, budgets, prompt-injection guards, trust levels, full audit, rollback everywhere.
- **Files:** server.js, tenancy.js, audit service, all new services.
- **Tasks:** per-scope rate limits; failure-context redaction; injection guards; remote trust; circuit breakers (extend `reliabilityState`).
- **Verification:** abuse tests, injection tests, tenant-isolation tests, regression.
- **Risks:** completeness.

# 13. Files That Should Exist (but do not)

Only the connective tissue — existing equivalents are reused, not duplicated:

| Proposed file | Why (no existing equivalent) |
|---|---|
| `backend/services/orchestrator_bridge.js` | Phase 4 plan/decompose/review loop (today only single `forge_submit`) |
| `backend/services/token_budget_manager.js` | enforce per-task/run/day API budget (cost_ledger only records) |
| `backend/services/prompt_cache_manager.js` | no semantic/prompt cache exists |
| `backend/services/result_verifier.js` | centralize "no fake-done" verification (logic is scattered) |
| `backend/services/remote_worker_registry.js` | Phase 7 (compute_fabric has no registry) |
| `backend/services/remote_job_dispatcher.js` | Phase 7 dispatch (no adapter today) |
| `backend/services/swarm_coordinator.js` | bridge forge runs → business_swarm (not wired) |
| `backend/routes/orchestrator.js` | HTTP surface for the orchestrator bridge |
| `backend/routes/remote_compute.js` | HTTP surface for worker registration/dispatch |
| `frontend …/OrchestrationPanel.jsx`, `TaskGraphPanel.jsx`, `RemoteComputePanel.jsx` | Phase 9 UI |

**Deliberately NOT proposed (already exist — reuse):** context pack builder → `forge_context_engine.js`; model capability router → `compute_planner.py` + `llm_provider_router.py`; sandbox runner → `infra/sandbox/executor.js`; api usage ledger → `cost_ledger.py`; local agent queue → `forge_queue_item` actions + new `dispatcher.js`; project indexer → `code_indexer.py`.

# 14. Final Verdict

**PARTIALLY — the core foundation exists but execution is weak/fragmented.**

The components of a real AI engineering engine are largely present and largely real: project indexing, context compression, multi-provider model routing, a sandbox, a Python lifecycle, distillation, a swarm scaffold, a full UI, and tests. What's missing is the **connective tissue** that turns parts into a system.

**What must be fixed first (in order):**
1. ✅ **Unify the forge execution path (GAP-1)** — DONE 2026-06-22: cockpit `/runs` now runs the lifecycle gate (spec→plan→review→test) before codegen, blocking vague/unsafe goals with clarifying questions. Follow-up: use plan slices to target codegen + surface open_questions in UI.
2. ✅ **Orchestrator bridge (GAP-2, Phase 4)** — DONE 2026-06-22: `context-pack` + `orchestrate` (task graph) + `runs/:id/failures` over the scoped-token + MCP surface. The brain now plans/decomposes/reviews; local agents execute after approval.
3. **Enforce context compression + token budget + cache (Phase 3)** ← NEXT — so the API-as-orchestrator design is cost-correct (no semantic cache / enforced budget yet — GAP-5).
4. **Then** remote compute (Phase 7) and swarm routing (Phase 8) for scale.

Today's session closed the highest-leverage prerequisites (clean baseline, programmatic least-privilege auth, and the approval→execution loop). The next highest-leverage move is **GAP-1 (unify the pipeline)**, then **Phase 4 (orchestrator bridge)**.
